This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a remote URI that returns a 404 error.  The `Image` component does not handle this gracefully and might either not render anything or render a broken image icon, without providing any clear indication of the failure to the developer. This makes debugging difficult as there is no helpful error message, just a blank space where the image should be.  The issue is especially problematic when the 404 occurs due to a dynamically generated image URI; tracking down the problem becomes much harder.
